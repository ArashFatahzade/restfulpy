A tool-chain for creating restful web applications.


## Goals:
 
- Automatically transform the SqlAlchemy models and queries into JSON with standard 
naming(camelCase).
- Http form validation based on SqlAlchemy models.
- A testing framework for REST application
- Generating the REST API documentation while the tests are passing. It helps to 
always deliver fresh API documentation.
